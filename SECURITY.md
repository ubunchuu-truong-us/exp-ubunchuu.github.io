# Security Policy

> ![NOTE]
> Security isn't just about finding vulnerabilities - it's about learning and growing together as a community. If you love Linux and want to help, you're welcome here!

## Our Approach

At Ubunchuu Trường Ú, we believe in open collaboration and community-driven security. While we take security seriously, we also want to make it accessible for everyone who loves Linux to contribute to making our project safer.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We welcome security reports from everyone, regardless of experience level:

1. **For Beginners**: If you notice something that doesn't look right, don't hesitate to open an issue. We appreciate your attention to detail!

2. **For Experienced Users**: Feel free to submit a pull request with your fix along with your report.

## How to Report

1. Create an issue labeled `security`
2. Describe what you found
3. If possible, suggest how to fix it
4. If you can, include:
   - The version/commit where you found the issue
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact

## Our Promise

- We'll respond to your report within 48 hours
- We won't make fun of simple reports - every security concern matters
- We'll credit you in our release notes (unless you prefer to stay anonymous)
- We'll keep you updated on our progress

## Supported Versions

- We maintain security updates for the latest version
- Older versions receive critical security patches

## Learning Together

Found a security issue but not sure how to report it properly? We're here to help! Connect with our community, and we'll guide you through the process.

## Recognition

We maintain a SECURITY-THANKS.md file listing everyone who has helped improve our project's security. Your contributions matter!
